<h2>Video Shot Detection Tool</h2>
<p>The Video Shot Boundary Detection is an application developed to identify two types of shot boundaries in a video file – cut scenes & gradual transitions. The tool is built using Python programming language, utilizes the ‘customtkinter’ library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and NumPy and OpenCV libraries for video processing .</p> 
<p>The primary functionality of this application is that it allows the user to select any video file and provides the cut scenes & transitions and allows the user to play those shots (video clipping, at 30 fps) till the next boundary is reached.
